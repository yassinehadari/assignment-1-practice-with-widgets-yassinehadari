# Assignment 1: Practice with Widgets

The objective of this first assignment is to familiarize yourselves with Android Studio
and the different tools that are shipped with the IDE. If you still haven't downloaded and installed
Android Studio, you will have to do it ASAP. Android Studio can be downloaded
here: https://developer.android.com/studio/

## Technical specifications
The provided starter code is configured to run on devices with at least Android Oreo (API 26). 
As a result, make sure that you have downloaded the appropriate version of the SDK in the SDK Manager.

If you possess an Android device that has not yet updated its version to Android Oreo, you can still
use an Android Virtual Device. You can create an AVD in the AVD Manager, remember to set its SDK version
to at least 26.

The starter code is provided as is, and should work on your laptop. If you face issues with using the 
starter code for your homework, please contact your instructor ASAP.

## Description of the App
In this assignment, you will manipulate basic widgets that we have seen during the first lecture:

- Button
- TextView
- EditText

Your assignment consists in adding an item of each to the MainActivity, with the following characteristics:

- The EditText will take the whole width of the Activity (minus small margins) and can display texts spanning
on several lines. 
- The Button, once clicked, should update the text of the TextView so as to display what was typed in
the EditText.
- The TextView should present design attributes similar to the ones of the EditText. In particular, it should
also be able to display text on several lines.


The look and design of the app is not important and won't be considered when grading your assignment.

__Bonus__: 
1. Create Buttons to change the font color of the TextView
2. Create Buttons to change the font size of the TextView

## Deadline for submission
Deadline: Exact date TBD

Lateness policy applies. Issues with configuring the IDE or the project can lead to an exceptional
extension without penalty.
